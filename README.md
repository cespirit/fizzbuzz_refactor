<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enter a non-decimal number greater than zero and press "enter" or click on the “Go!” button for the program to run.</li>
<li>If the entered number does not meet the above criteria, a message will alert the user to provide a valid input. If previous results exist, they will remain on the screen.</li> 
<li>Entering a new number will clear out the previous results and display the new set of results.</li>
</ul>
