<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enter a non-decimal number greater than zero and press "enter" or click on the “Go!” button for the program to run.</li>
<li>If the entered number does not meet the above criteria, a popup will alert the user to provide a valid input.</li> 
<li>When "enter" is pressed or the "Go!" button is clicked, the input box will be cleared out.</li>
<li>Entering a new number will also clear out the previous results, and if the number is valid, will display a new set of results.</li>
</ul>
